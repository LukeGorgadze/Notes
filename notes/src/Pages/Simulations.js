        Hi there, I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student, currently enrolled at <a href='https://www.kiu.edu.ge/' className='Ll'>KIU</a>.
        I have always been passionate about coding and math related subjects, so I love to experiment and explore interesting
        topics in these fields whenever I have a free time.

        Most recently, I was a Unity developer in a small game dev studio and worked there for more than a year, I gained lots
        experience and had a great fun.

        Regarding this website, I decided to keep track of my progress to some degree and maybe share it with others, out of sudden
        I thought it would be a great idea to write down some notes for the subjects i find interesting. Here you'll find my academical writings
        and stories about projects I did out of curiosity, so stay tuned!
